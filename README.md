# Pigeon Defense (Taubenabwehr)

Detects pigeons in video feed from a camera based on their form, size, color, and movement. The goal is to provide coordinates for a laser gun to scare pigeons away from specific areas without hurting them.

This project was a semester project at the University of Applied Sciences Northwestern Switzerland. It was done in collaboration with Kyriakos Schwarz.
